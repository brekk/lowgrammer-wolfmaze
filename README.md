## A game that trains programmers

### Let's make programmer-kids!

1. **Programming should be a basic skill. Everyone (society at large) would benefit if they had a basic understanding of programming.**

2. **Writing software should be part of elementary / primary education.**

In the same way that the educated populace has a basic command of mathematics, but there are also mathematicians who are very skilled and can engage with harder / more complex equations, there should be a similar class of people with a basic understanding of programming.

3. **It's important to use a real language, not one designed for kids.**

Real languages have real constraints.

Languages like Scratch][stratch] are terrible: **Flash is gross**; using an interface to make code doesn't teach you much; you should learn a whole language, and if you need to limit the environment / interface / whatever, do it through the API and encapsulation in the objects. Scratch is like SalesForce; it's written for people who don't have any real skills.

If you write something that doesn't compile / run in a real language, and  you fix it, and then it works, you've learned a valuable skill. If you write something in a mini-language (broadly speaking, an [educational programming language][epl]), you might have learned something, but it's not _that_ valuable. Certainly there's a place for these mini-languages, but I feel like languages that have been designed for kids:

  * Haven't been tested with the rigors of real use (by businesses, ostensibly)
  * Have a learning-life expectancy
  * Are designed with limits in mind â€” if you learn a real language that is used by an industry, you have a skill that can get you a job!
